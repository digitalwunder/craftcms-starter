# Craftcms Starter

We build a few craft websites for our clients and local development always was a little bit of a pain for us. So we decided to forge our own master of local development with this.

## About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It is optimized for bespoke web and application development, offering developers a clean slate to build out exactly what they want, rather than wrestling with a theme.

## Getting started

``` sh
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

After this setup up you Database and create the .env as usual. When this is done you can install craft through cli:

``` sh
./craft setup
```
